# FacialEmotionRecognition

- This research project is a series of experiments attempting to classify emotions from a collection of videos annotated with the help of a survey. There are broadly three approaches; the first employs a Convolutional Neural Network, and the second combines a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature descriptor and ML models like SVM,  KNN and Random Forest. The third approach uses an off-the-shelf, open-source python library, ’FER’, to classify the emotions from videos. FER-2013= and CK+ datasets are used to train models separately.

#Roadmap

There are several steps taken as mentioned in the report, there are three different approach used in this project:

1: A deep learning method using CNN
2: Histogram Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature descriptor and ML models like SVM,  KNN and Random Forest.
3: A python library for emotion recognition FER (Facial expression recognition).

Note:  Different Jupyter Notebooks are present for each method
